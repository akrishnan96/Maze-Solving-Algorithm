# Maze-Runner

Generating a Maze and Solving it using various Algorithms

1) We are using a Randomized Prims Algorithm to build the maze. The maze being built is randomized always.
2) The maze is then solved using 
    a) BFS
    b) DFS
    c) Djikstra
 and each of these traversal techniques are compared against each other
